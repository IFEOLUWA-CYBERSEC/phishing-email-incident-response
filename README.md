## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world SOC phishing investigation.  
The objective was to analyze a suspicious email, extract indicators of compromise (IOCs), assess risk, and recommend remediation actions following SOC playbooks.

## Tools Used
- VirusTotal
- ANY.RUN
- WHOIS
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Investigation Steps
- Email header analysis
- IOC extraction (IP, domain, email address)
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- Risk assessment
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Incident response recommendations

## Key Findings
- Phishing email leveraging social engineering techniques
- Clean IP reputation used to evade detection
- Medium to High risk to users if interacted with

## Outcome
A full incident report documenting analysis, response actions, and lessons learned, suitable for SOC Tier 1 workflows.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Phishing analysis
- Incident response
- Threat intelligence
- SOC documentation
